# Practical_3

### Introduction

In this weeks lecture, we looked at the machine learning (ML) training and tuning aspects of the ML pipeline. We looked at the ease of which a model from scikit-learn can be trained and tasked with a prediction. Recall that the code can entail 4 steps (import library --> initialise model --> fit the model --> prediction/test. We then looked at some of the metrics used to evaluate a model's performance. To put this to practice, and to combine your knowledge from the previous Practicals, in this week's tutorial you will build a supervised model to predict whether a patient is diabetic or not using recorded medical data. The dataset can be found within this repository, labelled <ins>'Dataset for People for their Blood Glucose Level with their Superficial body feature readings.'</ins>. Once you have imported the data into your python, please proceed with building a model that predicts whether a patient is diabetic or not. You can either do it independently or use the code below as a template.

Once you have finished, upload your report to your own github repo. Please 'Example_report' for guidance on how to structure the report.

### Cloning the repo to colab
   - Copy  and paste the following code into colab and then execture:
     - !git clone https://github.com/Dr-M-ELBA/Practical_3.git

#### A Few Points

- If you are using Colab, then all the python libraries would be readily available. For other environemnts, if you haven't already, you will need to install the:
  - Pandas library
  - numpy library
  - scikit-learn library
- If you decide to download the file, remeber the file path. You will need it for reading the excel file
- If you want to create more attractive figures, then consider importing the matplotlib and seaborn libraries
